# _uniqueIncreasingUint64

An idea for a C processing tool you run before a compile.

Closest currently existing feature is Clang's `__COUNTER__` macro: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#builtin-macros

> Defined to an integer value that starts at zero and is incremented each time the `__COUNTER__` macro is expanded.
